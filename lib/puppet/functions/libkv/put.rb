Puppet::Functions.create_function(:'libkv::put') do

  # @param key The key to set. Must conform to the following:
  #
  #   * Key must contain only the following characters:
  #
  #     * a-z
  #     * A-Z
  #     * 0-9
  #     * The following special characters: `._:-/`
  #
  #   * Key may not contain '/./' or '/../' sequences.
  #
  # @param value The value of the key
  # @param metadata Additional information to be persisted
  # @param options Hash that specifies global libkv options and/or the specific
  #   backend to use (with or without backend-specific configuration).
  #   Will be merged with `libkv::options`.
  #
  #   Supported options keys:
  #
  #   * `backends`: Hash.  Hash of backend configurations
  #
  #     * Each backend configuration in the merged options Hash must be
  #       a Hash that has the following keys:
  #
  #       * `type`:  Backend type.
  #       * `id`:  Unique name for the instance of the backend. (Same backend
  #         type can be configured differently).
  #
  #      * Other keys for configuration specific to the backend may also be
  #        present.
  #
  #   * `backend`: String.  Name of the backend to use.
  #
  #     * When present, must match a key in the `backends` option of the
  #       merged options Hash.
  #     * When absent and not specified in `libkv::options`, this function
  #       will look for a 'default.xxx' backend whose name matches the
  #       `resource` option.  This is typically the catalog resource id of the
  #       calling Class, specific defined type instance, or defined type.
  #       If no match is found, it will use the 'default' backend.
  #
  #   * `environment`: String.  Puppet environment to prepend to keys.
  #
  #     * When set to a non-empty string, it is prepended to the key used in
  #       the backend operation.
  #     * Should only be set to an empty string when the key being accessed is
  #       truly global.
  #     * Defaults to the Puppet environment for the node.
  #
  #   * `resource`: String.  Name of the Puppet resource initiating this libkv
  #     operation
  #
  #     * Required when `backend` is not specified and you want to be able
  #       to use more than the `default` backend.
  #     * String should be resource as it would appear in the catalog or
  #       some application grouping id
  #
  #       * 'Class[<class>]' for a class, e.g.  'Class[Mymodule::Myclass]'
  #       * '<Defined type>[<instance>]' for a defined type instance, e.g.,
  #         'Mymodule::Mydefine[myinstance]'
  #
  #     * Catalog resource id cannot be reliably determined automatically.
  #       Appropriate scope is not necessarily available when a libkv function
  #       is called within any other function.  This is problematic for heavily
  #       used Puppet built-in functions such as `each`.
  #
  #  * `softfail`: Boolean. Whether to ignore libkv operation failures.
  #
  #    * When `true`, this function will return a result even when the operation
  #      failed at the backend.
  #    * When `false`, this function will fail when the backend operation failed.
  #    * Defaults to `false`.
  #
  # @raise [ArgumentError] If the key or merged backend config is invalid
  #
  # @raise [LoadError] If the libkv adapter cannot be loaded
  #
  # @raise [RuntimeError] If the backend operation fails, unless 'softfail' is
  #   `true` in the merged backend options.
  #
  # @return [Boolean] `true` when backend operation succeeds; `false` when the
  #   backend operation fails and 'softfail' is `true` in the merged backend
  #   options
