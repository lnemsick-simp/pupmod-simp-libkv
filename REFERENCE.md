## Functions

### libkv::add_libkv

Type: Ruby 4.x API

Add libkv 'extension' to the catalog instance, if it is not present

#### `libkv::add_libkv()`

Add libkv 'extension' to the catalog instance, if it is not present

Returns: `Nil`

Raises:
* `LoadError` if libkv adapter software fails to load

### libkv::delete

Type: Ruby 4.x API

Deletes a `key` from the configured backend.

#### `libkv::delete(String[1] $key, Optional[Hash] $options)`

Deletes a `key` from the configured backend.

Returns: `Boolean` `true` when backend operation succeeds; `false` when the
backend operation fails and 'softfail' is `true` in the merged backend
options

Raises:
* `If` the key or merged backend config is invalid
* `If` the libkv adapter cannot be loaded
* `If` the backend operation fails, unless 'softfail' is `true` in the merged backend options.

##### `key`

Data type: `String[1]`

The key to be removed

##### `options`

Data type: `Optional[Hash]`

Hash that specifies global libkv options and/or the specific
backend to use (with or without backend-specific configuration).
Will be merged with `libkv::options`.

Supported options keys:

* `backends`: Hash.  Hash of backend configurations

  * Each backend configuration in the merged options Hash must be
    a Hash that has the following keys:

    * `type`:  Backend type.
    * `id`:  Unique name for the instance of the backend. (Same backend
      type can be configured differently).

   * Other keys for configuration specific to the backend may also be
     present.

* `backend`: String.  Name of the backend to use.

  * When present, must match a key in the `backends` option of the
    merged options Hash.
  * When absent and not specified in `libkv::options`, this function
    will look for a 'default.xxx' backend whose name matches the
    catalog resource id of the calling Class, specific defined type
    instance, or defined type.  If no match is found, it will use
    the 'default' backend.

* `environment`: String.  Puppet environment to prepend to keys.

  * When set to a non-empty string, it is prepended to the key used in
    the backend operation.
  * Should only be set to an empty string when the key being accessed is
    truly global.
  * Defaults to the Puppet environment for the node.
